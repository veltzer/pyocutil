- symlink_install command does not create the target folder
	It assumes that this folder exists, and in most cases it does
	But sometimes it doesnt so we should create the target folder.
- add mkdir_for command which makes all folders for a file.
	just like
		mkdir -p $(dir $@))
	in a makefile
- improve the symlink install operation to be smarter:
	- don't install every symlink.
		- If the symlink already exists and is pointing at the right
		place then do nothing.
		- If the symlink already exists and is pointing at the wrong
		place then remove it and put the right symlink in.
		- If the symlink doesn't exists then install the new symlink.
	- check if there are old symlinks to remove
		scan the target folder and for every symlink that points
		to the source folder that is not currently available - remove
		that symlink.
